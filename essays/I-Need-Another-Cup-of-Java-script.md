## Prompt 

So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

## Introduction

I am studying Electrical Engineering, Electro-Physics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I have taken courses in the C and C++ languages. Last week was my first introduction to the Javascript language. It seemed very intuitive, and the exercises on freeCodeCamp helped to boost my confidence, and subsequently my ego, in my Javascript capabilities. I could not have been more wrong.

## Javascript versus My Native Tongue

I thought Javascript was my passion, but I do not think it is anymore.

From a software engineering perspective, it seems to me that Javascript is very useful. Being a high-level language, it is relatively easy to turn thoughts into code. It is also very flexible and seemingly intuitive.

Coming from a background in C and C++, the syntax in Javascript was relatively to catch on to. However, Javascript seems to have a significant amount of internal functions and operators, compared to C++.

## My Software Marathon Training

I can run 2-miles in 14-minutes, but these "athletic" Workouts of the Day (WODs) have me out of breath, more than ever. I found the practice WODs to be useful, but not necessarily in the conventional way. The practice WODs helped to get me much more comfortable coding in Javascript while under a time limit, and consequently, under pressure. Sometimes, I felt like Rocky Balboa. This was good practice for the actual WOD situation, and I felt that I was prepared well in that sense.

In high school, I was in the Air Riflery program. You have to be as relaxed as possible when you aim and shoot the pellet at the target. At times, you start spacing out and getting frustrated. The best thing to do at that time is to take a step back and collect yourself. The practice WODs reminded me to simply take a deep breath while in the midst of frustration and break the problem down into different layers and pieces.

The practice WODs, especially the bWOD, showed that there were large gaps in my ability to implement certain structures and algorithms to solve specific problems. In C++, most of my labs were focused on stressing object oriented features of the respective language, so I was slightly lacking in experience related to standard "cut-and-paste" methods of producing functions. 

## WOD Preparation

I did both practice WODs. I was able to solve the Practice WOD #1 on my first try in 05:33:04. My first try was very "hard-coded" in the sense that I had not defined a function. I simply used a for loop in my code and changed the values. Based on the feedback from my instructor, I learned the value of code flexibility when creating functions to solve problems. I repeated the practice WODs with a fresh mind, and I was able to solve the problem a few seconds faster every time.

```js
let sum = 0;

for(let i = 1; i < 1000; i++) {
	if(i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
  	sum += i;
  }
}

console.log(sum);
```


My TA, Branden Ogata, holds weekly practice sessions. His WODs are called the bWODs. The bWOD this week dealt with sorting through arrays and comparing values.

It took me a long time to finish Practice WOD #2

## The Final Countdown

I was having a good day, and I felt as read as I would ever be for my first ever WOD. I walked into class, joked around with my friends, and Professor
