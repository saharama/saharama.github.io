XC: Covid and College
The Covid pandemic has disrupted global human civilization. But how has it disrupted you? It can be therapeutic to spend a little bit of time reflecting on how your life has changed in the past few weeks and to think about how you might best move forward in the face of great uncertainty.

This is an extra credit assignment. It will be graded on a scale of 0 - 100 points depending upon the quality of the essay. In your essay, discuss how Covid has impacted upon your life as a college student. You can discuss anything of importance to you; here are some potential topics:

What has changed in your daily routine?
What additional family, community, or work obligations you are taking on?
How has Covid impacted your ability to learn, not just in ICS 314, but also in any of your other classes?
What new things have you learned about yourself, your family, your friends, and your community?
What changes do you think you need to make in order to move forward successfully?
