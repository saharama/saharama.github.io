## Prompt

Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

## Play it Smart

In the words, of a wise man: "I have a theory. People talk loud when they want to sound smart, right? Maybe if we play loud, people will think we're good." (Squidward Tentacles, 2001).

Perhaps, if developers asked smart questions, they may appear to be smart. Not only do "smart-questions" explain problems and symptoms clearly, but they also show a certain threshold of respect and willingness to learn towards the programming community

## Asking like a Pro

First, search StackOverflow for a question submitted by a developer that demonstrates the “smart way”. Such a question should follow the precepts established by Raymond. In addition, the answers provided by the community should demonstrate that asking a question the smart way leads to both efficient and effective help.

We first take a look at a question that showcases great question format and proposal.

Example of a good question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9371238/why-is-reading-lines-from-stdin-much-slower-in-c-than-python"> Reading lines in C versus Python</a>

This was also very effective because the author of the question continued to update his post. There is a summary of the answer to his question denoted at the top.

## Back to the Drawing Screen

Next, you will search for a question submitted by a different developer that demonstrates the “not smart way”. In other words, this question violates the principles established by Raymond. In addition, the answers provided by the community should demonstrate that asking a question in a “not smart” way does not lead to both effective and efficient help

Example of question needing work: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11819536/converting-a-decimal-array-into-a-2d-16bit-character-array-in-c"> Converting arrays</a>


## Wrap-Up

After searching through many StackOverflow posts online and extracting both extremes of smart-questions, I have gained a newfound respect for those who ask good questions with great attitudes.

The goal of this exercise is not to “prove” that asking questions the smart way is always better. Instead, the goal of this exercise is to help you form a deeper understanding of what constitutes “smart” and “not smart” questions so that you are more likely to ask smart ones in the future.
