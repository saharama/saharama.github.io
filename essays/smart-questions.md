## Prompt

For this experience, you will use StackOverflow to provide examples of the positive outcomes that can potentially occur when software engineers follow the guidelines, and the negative outcomes that can potentially occur when software engineers don’t.

First, search StackOverflow for a question submitted by a developer that demonstrates the “smart way”. Such a question should follow the precepts established by Raymond. In addition, the answers provided by the community should demonstrate that asking a question the smart way leads to both efficient and effective help.

Next, you will search for a question submitted by a different developer that demonstrates the “not smart way”. In other words, this question violates the principles established by Raymond. In addition, the answers provided by the community should demonstrate that asking a question in a “not smart” way does not lead to both effective and efficient help

The goal of this exercise is not to “prove” that asking questions the smart way is always better (although it would be quite interesting to design an empirical study using StackOverflow to actually gather data on whether “smart” questions do indeed, on average, lead to more effective and efficient answers). Instead, the goal of this exercise is to help you form a deeper understanding of what constitutes “smart” and “not smart” questions so that you are more likely to ask smart ones in the future.

## bruh

Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.
