## Play it Smart

In the words, of a wise man: "I have a theory. People talk loud when they want to sound smart, right? Maybe if we play loud, people will think we're good." (Squidward Tentacles, 2001).

If developers asked smart questions, they likely appear to be smart. Not only do "smart-questions" explain problems and symptoms clearly, but they also show a certain threshold of respect and willingness to learn towards the programming community. Great concise questions will entice others to contribute toward a great solution.

## Asking like a Pro

We first take a look at a question that showcases great question format and proposal. We also note that this user clearly states what he has tried, and mentions certain details that pertain to "symptoms". Although there are many good points in the question, the title could be a little more precise to get straight to the point.

Example of a good question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9371238/why-is-reading-lines-from-stdin-much-slower-in-c-than-python"> Reading lines in C versus Python</a>

In this excellent example, the inquirer clearly states the question and attaches screenshots of relevant code. What truly stands out is the fact that the author of the question continued to update his post. There is a summary of the answer to his question denoted at the top. The author of the post also keeps his language very humble and open-minded which shows a lot of respect to potential aids.

Consequently, this post received many great responses. Because of its inital clarity of both question and details, this question was able to get much thoughtful information and solutions.

## Back to the Drawing Screen

Now we view a question that needs some work. The author of the question asked for help with a program to convert numbers. The author decided to ask the question and post large snippets of code into the question, showing little-to-no higher level thinking.

Example of question needing work: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11819536/converting-a-decimal-array-into-a-2d-16bit-character-array-in-c"> Converting arrays</a>

As we can see in the responses from the community, the inital unclear question led to many more requests from information from the individuals attempting to help this developer. This lead to a delayed response and confusion on both sides. In addition, the post likely did not have many attempts to answer because of its poor format and lack of initial information.

## Wrap-Up

After searching through many StackOverflow posts online and extracting both extremes of smart-questions, I have gained a newfound respect for those who ask good questions with great attitudes. I feel compelled to add much more detail into questions I add into the future, because I now understand that it can entice people to answer my question, while also speed up the total time it takes to get good help.
