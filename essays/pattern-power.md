## What are design patterns? CHANGE

Intro/hook to title


The book, as shown by the picture to the right from an Amazon.com listing, explains 48 different methods of obtaining


Similarly
Design pattern
-name
-problem (when to apply)
-solution (how everything is hooked up)
-consequences (trade-offs)

Examples:
-Factory:  
-Singleton:
-Observer:
-Model-View-Controller (MVC):

-Publish Subscribe:

## How I have used them in my code? CHANGE Playing with Electricity
I can talk about design patterns in my final project here.


next i can talk about my coding experiences in EE (system level design)
- EE160: simple game for Timmy and Jujus
- EE205: my game was a state machine (i think it follows the observer method.... double check with the video)
- EE260/EE361: FPGA/Microprocessors (centralized)

## A "Shocking" Twist
As a student studying Electrical Engineering, there are definitely existing design patterns. For instance, you can apply different circuit configurations to the different pins of a transistor to give it either the qualities of a switch or an amplifier. During my summer internship, as depicted in the adjacent photo, I helped to design parts of a microgrid power system for a small community. In this case, my mentor explained a list of different switchgear and electrical circuit breaker configurations and challenged me to justify why we had chosen the design that we did. In addition to the power configuration, I also worked on the development of the network and control connections, as different portions of our power grid would need to be monitored or controlled remotely. Noting that the majority of my target audience at the moment are software-oriented individuals, I do not expect the average reader to completely understand what I just said. However, I wanted to stress the fact that very similar to software design patterns, I was also able to identify design patterns for electric power systems and networks. In the end, design patterns help us to generalize problems and understand the benefits of certain methods from a system level perspective. Many times in engineering, these patterns are not explicitly explained to entry-level hires. Therefore, it has been very beneficial to me to understand that many complex system follow general design patterns, and I definitely hope to use this new perspective to my benefit in the near future!
