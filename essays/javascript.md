## The Critic's Corner

Throughout my experiences in the College of Engineering, I have experience with C, C++, and Python. I have very minor experiences with Javascript, but it does not appear to be too difficult. In respect to C and C++, Javascript is not completely different. There are slightly different rules that can be very confusing at times, but overall, Javascript has been quite intuitive. It is important to note that the suble differences could turn out to be major problems. For instance, we are able to modify strings, like arrays, in C and C++; however, in Javascript, strings cannot be modified.

The ES6 features that we learned about were slightly difficult to remember, but I see how they can be useful to optimize code. Although my initial reaction to the ES6 functions were similar to that of my face in the above picture. They seem to have a lot of potential benefits, if I am able to become more comfortable with them over time. 



If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?
