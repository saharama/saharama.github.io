## About Me
Aloha, my name is Matthew Sahara. This essay serves to tell a little about my professional interests and how they relate to software engineering techniques and concepts stressed in this class.

I am majoring in Electrical Engineering in the Electro-Physics track. I have experience with C, C++, and Python. ICS314 fulfills my Engineering Breadth and Writing Intensive academic requirements. My peers in the Computer Science department recommended this class to me because they were able to implement these efficient software engineering concepts into their own projects.


## Interesting Interests
Majoring in Electrical Engineering, I work in a network security research group, where I analyze trends in network-based communcation between drones. We use Python scripts to analyze data and produce statistics to create profiles for specific drones. In addition, I find Python heavily used in electro-physical based applications as well. You might be thinking: "How does this relate to Software Engineering?" In reality, one of the former lab members in my electronics lab wrote Python scripts to collect data from a Vector Network Analyzer machine, which measures transmitted and reflected power values of a device-under-test. In Electrical Engineering research, a large portion of data analysis revolves around software, and has proven to be an invaluable resource.

Over the summer, I was lucky to have the opportunity to intern with Burns & McDonnell, an engineering company that focuses on design-build construction work. I worked on the network architecture and medium-voltage switchgear for a microgrid for a community. The microgrid was designed to make the community self-sustainable, incorporating renewable energy, in the event of an emergency in which the electric utility is unable to supply power.


## Software or Hardware?
Although I am still unsure what career path and field in Electrical Engineering I want to pursue, it is apparent that software plays a big part in the simulation, automation, and efficiency in all of these fields.

As explained above, software plays a large part in the success of these labs, in both software and hardware related fields. I look forward to learning about the efficient development of software in groups. The concept of git has always phased me, and I used it for a short period of time for a C++ project in my EE205 class. I hope to expand upon my limited knowledge and build essential project management skills for real-world development.

In RF and Microwave Circuit design, we also rely heavily on software for both simulation and testing of RF devices, circuits, and systems. Many companies are now looking for potential RF engineers that know the electromagnetic theories and also know how to code well. This class 

For instance, power design companies rely on software to correctly size and check safety devices and equipment, such as electrical breakers and cables. Power Engineering software plays a big part in ensuring the safety of the average person. The existing software in the Power Engineering is utilitarian and has many known issues that slow down the design engineer running simulations. In the future, I hope to potentially work on a team to redesign and optimize the current, supposed state-of-the-art software to increase the productivity and ease of Electrical Engineering design to make the community a better and safer place. 

In addition, there is a Software Engineering section on the Fundamentals Exam (FE) for engineers. Essentially, this exam is the first step in the journey to becoming a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), who can sign off or stamp design drawings. The PE license brings both credibility and legal responsibility to the individual. I see this class definitely developing my software skills to help me do well on this exam.


## Moving Forward - I See The Light(ing)!
In the future, I hope to further automate and optimize work that I see myself doing in the future. In terms of short-term goals, I h

I hope that I will build a strong foundation in software engineering through my work in this class.
