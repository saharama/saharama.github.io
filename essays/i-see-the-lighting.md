## About Me
Aloha, my name is Matthew Sahara. This essay serves to tell a little about my professional interests and how they relate to software engineering techniques and concepts stressed in this class.

I am majoring in Electrical Engineering in the Electro-Physics track. I have experience with C, C++, and Python. ICS314 fulfills my Engineering Breadth and Writing Intensive academic requirements. My peers in the Computer Science program recommended this class to me.


## Interesting Interests
Majoring in Electrical Engineering, I work in a network security research group, where I analyze trends in network-based communcation between drones. We use Python scripts to analyze data and produce statistics to create profiles for specific drones. In addition, I find Python heavily used in electro-physical based applications as well. You might be thinking: "How does this relate to Software Engineering?" In reality, one of the former lab members in my electronics lab wrote Python scripts to collect data from a Vector Network Analyzer machine, which measures transmitted and reflected power values of a device-under-test. Over the summer, I was lucky to have the opportunity to intern with Burns & McDonnell, an engineering company that focuses on design-build construction work. I worked on the electrical power and communication systems for a microgrid. We relied heavily on simulation software to ensure the safe operation of our system. In both Electrical Engineering research and industry settings, a large portion of analysis revolves around software, and it has proven to be an invaluable resource.


## Software or Hardware?
Although I am still unsure what career path and field in Electrical Engineering I want to pursue, it is apparent that software plays a big part in the simulation, automation, and efficiency in all of these fields. I look forward to learning about the productive development of software in groups. The concept of git has always phased me, and I used it for a short period of time for a C++ project in my EE205 class. I hope to expand upon my limited knowledge and build essential project management skills for real-world software development.


## Moving Forward - I See The Light(ing)!
In the future, I hope to further automate and optimize work that I see myself doing in the future. Many companies are now looking for Electrical Engineers that know the electromagnetic theories and also know how to code well. However, even if I am not able to find a software-oriented job, I predict that the methodologies in the class can easily be applied to different fields. I hope that this class will help me to grow as a future engineer and help to boost my problem solving capabilities. Although my passion involves electrons and photons, I hope to see the light in software engineering.
