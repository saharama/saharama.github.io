## Software Engineering Prompt
In the well known movie, "Mulan", the main character Mulan sees her reflection in a the pond, in the midst of an existential crisis, and asks herself, "When will my reflection show who I am inside?" In some ways, I feel like Mulan in relation to the ICS314 athletic software engineering experience. At the beginning, I was reluctant to take this class because I heard that it was a lot of work, yet the results were great. Looking back at my former self who could only code in C++ and share code on Google Docs, we have come quite the long way. I have learned countless things in terms of web development, but more importantly, about fundamental software engineering concepts that I can apply to further improve other aspects of my education and research.


fundamental software engineering concepts:

Configuration Management
Functional Programming
Coding Standards
User Interface Frameworks
Agile Project Management
Design Patterns


For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example,


lets talk about:

## Functional programming
- functional programming

## Coding Standards
- Coding standards

## Agile Project Management
- agile project management
 you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. You must define these terms if you are using them.

## Who I Am Inside
Now that you are almost done with this class, I would like you to write on last essay that summarizes what you’ve learned about software engineering.
