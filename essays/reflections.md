## Software Engineering Prompt
In the well known movie, "Mulan", the main character Mulan sees her reflection in a the pond, in the midst of an existential crisis, and asks herself, "When will my reflection show who I am inside?" In some ways, I feel like Mulan in relation to the ICS314 athletic software engineering experience. At the beginning, I was reluctant to take this class because I heard that it was a lot of work, yet the results were great. Looking back at my former self who could only code in C++ and share code primarily on Google Drive, we have come quite the long way. I have learned countless things in terms of web development, but more importantly, about fundamental software engineering concepts that I can apply to further improve other aspects of my education and research.

## Agile Project Management

A vital part of this class turned out to *Agile Project Management*, which essentially is the concept of breaking down the project into smaller tasks and systematically tackling each task to aid with efficiency of development and quality control. In our project, we used a certain style referred to as *Issue Driven Project Management*, which is

Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. You must define these terms if you are using them.

## Who I Am Inside
I think that the most important takeaway from this class is how to develop a consistent study schedule for success in academics. In this class we experienced *athletic software engineering* where we were given software-based assignments nearly everyday. This was very different, as one of my previous professors used to say it was actually more efficient to work on code in larger, more concentrated chunks of time. On the contrary, this class helped to make it clear that slowly tackling concepts day-by-day is much more beneficial, at least for me and the majority of other individuals. As I expected to, I learned a lot about using tools to produce quality software as part of a team. However, this class also helped to develop my attitude and work ethic as a student. Actively applying *athletic learning* to all of my classes truly helped me to become a better student, and I am forever grateful to Dr. Johnson and his ICS314 class for teaching me how to learn. The old quote by Maimonides, a philosopher, says, "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime." ICS314 has taught me how to learn more efficiently. Maybe now instead of seeing my reflection in the water like Mulan, I can finally start to see the fish.
