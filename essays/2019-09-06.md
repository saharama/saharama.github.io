## Prompt 

So. What do you think about Javascript so far? If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?


## Thoughts about Javascript

I thought Javascript was my passion, but I do not think it is anymore. My major is Electrical Engineering, so I have taken courses in C and C++. I am a complete newbie to Javascript. 

From a software engineering perspective, it seems to me that Javascript is very useful. Being a high-level language, it is relatively easy to turn thoughts into code. It is also very flexible and seemingly intuitive.

## Athleticism

I can run 2-miles in 14-minutes, but these "athletic" WODs have me hyperventilating more than ever.
