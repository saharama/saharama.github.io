## Scrambled Egg-Is-Thick or Ethics?
Back in the day, I used to be a Boy Scout. I attended many hikes, service projects, and camps. Eventually I became an Eagle Scout. The catch is that I was one of the few Eagle Scouts that absolutely hated eggs! I have always despised how bland and occasionally chewy the scrambled eggs were, especially at camp when the new kids were cooking! At first, I had to eat them in little chunks, gagging after every spoonful. As I grew older, I eventually began to recognize two things. First, I could smother eggs with ketchup and salt to avoid the taste. Secondly, I acknowledged them as an essential evil—eggs help to fill you up and keep you full for a busy day.

In many cases, I find eggs to be like ethics. While eggs are good and ethics are evil, they both may make individuals uncomfortable, but they are necessary for a good, productive, and fair society. In all seriousness, ethics in the context of software engineering are essential, as our developing society becomes increasingly dependent on the automatic and assistance of computers.

You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering.

Then, describe the situation you chose to analyze with respect to its ethical implications.

Finally, present your conclusions: what is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?
