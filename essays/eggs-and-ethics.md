## Scrambled Egg-Is-Thick or Ethics?
Back in the day, I used to be a Boy Scout. I attended many hikes, service projects, and camps. Eventually I became an Eagle Scout. The catch is that I was one of the few Eagle Scouts that absolutely hated eggs! I have always despised how bland, dry, and chewy the scrambled eggs were, especially at the camp when the new kids were cooking! At first, I had to eat them in little chunks, gagging after every spoonful. As I grew older, I eventually began to recognize two things. First, I could smother eggs with ketchup and salt to avoid both the traumatic memories and the awful taste. Secondly, I acknowledged them as an essential evil—eggs help to fill you up and give you energy to tackle a busy, stressful day.

In many cases, I find eggs to be like ethics. While eggs are good and ethics are evil, they have a lot in common. Both may tend to make individuals uncomfortable, but they are necessary for a good, productive, and fair society. In all seriousness, ethics in the context of software engineering are essential, as our developing society becomes increasingly dependent on the automation and assistance provided by computers.

You should begin by discussing, in your own words, what you think “ethics” means in the context of software engineering.

## No Eggs, No Ethics
In the Case Studies featured in the module, we looked at harassment via virtual applications, ethical decision making in Artificial Intelligence, and poorly defined lines in regards to privacy of data. I found the [The Code I'm Still Ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e#.tsjl7lkxy) case to be particularly insightful to me. To summarize the article in short, a young software developer in a marketing firm was given the task of working on a website for a drug advertisement. The client company's specifications for the application included a quiz that, in most cases, led to the recommendation of the respective company's drug. The author explicitly notes that the website was seemed to be geared toward adolescent girls, and his project manager questioned his finished product, only to finally yield to the client's specified requests.

## The Days After Easter

Finally, present your conclusions: what is your personal opinion as to the ethical stance to be taken?

Let's be real here. Many people dread the days after Easter, for those are the melancholy days where we must consume all of the eggs that children dyed on the day prior. In the same way, many people find a code of ethics to be a hindrance to their work. On the contrary, a code of ethics serves as a guideline as basis for good moral decisions in engineering.
