## Scrambled Egg-Is-Thick or Eth-ics?
Back in the day, I used to be a Boy Scout. I attended many hikes, service projects, and camps. Eventually, I became an Eagle Scout. The catch is that I was one of the few Eagle Scouts that absolutely hated eggs! I have always despised how bland, dry, and chewy the scrambled eggs were, especially at Boy Scout camps when the new kids were cooking! At first, I had to eat them in little chunks, gagging after every spoonful. As I grew older, I eventually began to recognize two things. First, I could smother eggs with ketchup and salt to avoid both the traumatic memories and the awful taste. Secondly, I acknowledged them as an essential evilâ€”eggs help to fill you up and give you energy to tackle a busy, stressful day.

In many cases, I find eggs to be like ethics. Both may tend to make individuals uncomfortable, but they are necessary for a good, productive, and fair society. In all seriousness, ethics in the context of software engineering are essential as our developing society becomes increasingly dependent on the automation and assistance provided by computers. To me, ethics in software engineering means to both be technically proficient in the work that one produces, and to minimize related risks. Continued development of technical proficiency is a must, but a software engineer also needs to think about the physical, mental, and social implications of their work. As displayed in the case studies mentioned in the next section, we find that software can be used for morally controversial issues and decisions. In software engineering, we must recognize conflicts of interests and operate in the best interest of the world as a whole.

## No Eggs, No Ethics
In the Case Studies featured in the module, we looked at harassment via virtual applications, ethical decision making in Artificial Intelligence, and poorly defined lines in regard to privacy of data. I found the [The Code I'm Still Ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e#.tsjl7lkxy) case to be particularly insightful to me. To summarize the article, the author, young software developer in an interactive marketing firm was given the task of working on a website for a drug advertisement. The client company's specifications for the seemingly informational application included a quiz that, in most cases, led to the recommendation of the client company's drug. The author explicitly notes that the website seemed to be geared toward adolescent girls, and his project manager questioned his finished product, only to finally yield to the client's specified requests. The author later finds out that a girl died due to the suicidal side effects of the drug.

The author expresses guilt knowing that his or her work contributed to the death of a young girl. It is later revealed that by coincidence, the author's sister also started to take the drug. In this case, the author was able to grasp a heightened understanding of the ethical side effects produced by his or her professional work. Many times, we do not directly see the consequences of our work like in this situation; however, we should still consider the weight of all lives equally in the work that we produce. Software engineers will likely spend most of their days inside of an office which may lead to a detachment from the regular world. Likewise, it is quite important to set aside time to think about the second-order effects of the work that we produce, so we do not become *egg-norant*. In addition, many young engineers might act like *chickens* and try to avoid bringing up ethical issues, in fear of retaliation by managers or corporations. On the contrary, I feel that it is very important to have consistent goals and morals with the company you work with, in order to have a happy and successful career. Therefore, young workers should feel comfortable with expressing ethical dilemmas with their managers, and should not be afraid to risk their jobs because there is likely a company somewhere that values integrity and would love to higher a candidate with an excellent moral compass.

## The Days After Easter

Let's be honest. Many people dread the days after Easter, for those are the melancholy days where we must consume all of the eggs that kids dyed on the day prior. In the same way, many people find the guidelines provided by code of ethics to be a hindrance to their work. Some "egg" heads may simply find it a hassle to think about such things. Just as we need to eat all of the leftover dyed eggs, software engineers must consider and minimize potential risks, social complications, and the privacy and well-being of each living thing. By doing so, we can effectively implement software to safely and respectfully increase the quality of life for people around the world. We find that software and ethics go hand-in-hand. After all, you cannot spell ethics without ICS.
