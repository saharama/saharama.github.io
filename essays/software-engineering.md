## Software Engineering Prompt
Now that you are almost done with this class, I would like you to write on last essay that summarizes what you’ve learned about software engineering.

Because the technology stack for this class is designed for the creation of web applications, some students think this class is simply about web application development.
Of course, web application development is a skill you’ve acquired in this class, but the more fundamental goal of this class is for you to:     
acquire experience with fundamental software engineering concepts including:

Open Source Software Development
Configuration Management
Functional Programming
Development Environments
Coding Standards
User Interface Frameworks
Agile Project Management
Design Patterns
Ethics in Software Engineering

For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.


lets talk about:
- functional programming
- agile project management
- and one more

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. You must define these terms if you are using them.
