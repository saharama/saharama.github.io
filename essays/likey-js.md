## You Know... I Have Standards!
As I downloaded IntelliJ, I did not think it was very intelligent at all. I was confused with how to use it, and I thought that there were too many settings and plugins to keep track of. In retrospect, perhaps I was the one with the lack of intelligence. After the headache of configuring IntelliJ for fast startup times, the athletic software engineering side of this class was a breeze. Using the ESLint tool, we learned more about making clear code in Javascript. ESLint helps to identify whitespace preferences to ensure that code is produced in a clear and more concise manner. In addition, it has also taught me about using proper variable declaration habits, especially when using const and var.

## The Status Quo
Most aspects in our lives are generally controlled by rules whether it be based on legal definitions or even the fundamental laws of physics! Because most things have rules to prevent unwanted consequences, software development should also be governed by a set of rules. As a Teaching Assistant for a C programming lab in the Electrical Engineering (EE) department, I have seem my fair share of "spaghetti code"! I strongly believe that learning code in a classroom setting is beneficial because the instructors are able to teach conventional standards that normally would not be covered in independent study. I had no idea what lint was, and I feel that it is simply amazing! In the EE department, we use code in a very utilitarian sense, and do not explicitly cover camelCase or indenting.

## Think Twice about ESLint
In my personal experiences with ESLint, it has helped me to better understand the rules and conventions associated with Javascript code. In the first few weeks of class, we learned general capabilities of Javascript, including object-oriented and function programming. This past week, we were introduced to coding with GitHub Desktop, and we polished our Javascript skills using IntelliJ and ESLint. The ESLint tool helped to make my code much more efficient and easier to understand.

Using the words of the popular Korean pop group, Twice: I definitely "likey-likey-likey" IntelliJ and ESLint.
