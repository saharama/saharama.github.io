## You Know... I Have Standards!

As I downloaded IntelliJ, I did not think it was very intelligent at all. I was confused with how to use it, and I thought that there were too many settings and plugins to keep track of. In retrospect, perhaps I was the one with the lack of intelligence. After the headache of configuring IntelliJ for fast startup times, the athletic software engineering side of this class was a breeze. Using the ESLint tool, we learned more about making clear code in Javascript. ESLint helped to identify whitespace preferences to ensure that code was produced in a clear and more concise manner. In addition, it has also taught me about using proper variable declaration habits, especially when using const and var.

## The Status Quo

Most aspects in our lives are generally controlled by rules, whether it be based on legal definitions or even the fundamental laws of physics! Proper programming is the same. Code is also similar to an essayâ€”you might be able to get your point across or compile your code, but the way you wrote it could be unclear or inefficient. As a Teaching Assistant for a C programming lab in the Electrical Engineering (EE) department, I have seem my fair share of "spaghetti code"! I strongly believe that learning code in a classroom setting is beneficial because the instructors are able to teach conventional standards that normally would not be covered in independent study. I had no idea what lint was, and I feel that it is simply amazing! In the ICS department, I have learned a lot more about general coding practices, such as camelCase and proper indents. IntelliJ along with ESLint provide a coding environment that is conducive to more clear and efficient code.

## Thinking Twice about ESLint

In my personal experiences with ESLint, it has helped me to better understand the rules and conventions associated with Javascript code. In the first few weeks of class, we learned general capabilities of Javascript, including object-oriented and functional programming. This past week, we were introduced to coding with GitHub Desktop, and we polished our Javascript skills using IntelliJ and ESLint. The ESLint tool helped me to produce code that was much more efficient and easier to understand.

Using the words of the popular Korean pop group, Twice: I definitely "likey-likey-likey" coding standards.
