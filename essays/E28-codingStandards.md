Many people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.

I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.

## You Know... I Have Standards!


## Breaking the Law
Most aspects in our lives are generally controlled by rules whether it be based on legal definitions or even the fundamental laws of physics! Because most things have rules to prevent unwanted consequences, software development should also be governed by a set of rules. As a Teaching Assistant for a C programming lab in the Electrical Engineering department, I have seem my fair share of "spaghetti code"! I strongly believe that learning code in a classroom setting is beneficial because the instructors are able to teach conventional standards that normally would not be covered in independent study. I had no idea what lint was, and I feel that it is simply amazing!

## Friend or Foe?
(IntelliJ)
I think that ESLint provides a plethora of benefits.


## My Buddy ESLint
In my personal experiences with ESLint, it has helped me to better understand the rules and convention associated with Javascript.
