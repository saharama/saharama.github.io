UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Semantic UI? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?

For this assignment, create an engaging and informative essay about UI Frameworks. You might want to discuss some of the issues raised above, as well as your own personal experience with Semantic UI.

Feel free to go in another direction entirely, as long as you are discussing UI Frameworks, and as long as the result is interesting, informative, and insightful. Write for the world!

## Full of Disappointments
The title of this essay, "Hello Frameworks", seems to be very dry and actually quite disappointing. Hopefully by the end of this essay, you will gain a deeper understanding of its use.

This was my first exposure to a framework. Learning to work with the Semantic UI framework was honestly quite tough for me.
