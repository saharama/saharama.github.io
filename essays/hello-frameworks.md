## Hello There

Hello Semantic UI! This was my first exposure to a framework. Learning to work with the Semantic UI framework was honestly quite tough for me. Coming in with little to no experience, the previous HTML and CSS course module was a very brief crash course. Semantic UI was a lot easier to write, but it took some time for the framework to start becoming intuitive. Similar to my feelings about Semantic UI, this report may seem full of disappointment at first, but it will slowly start to make sense as we progress.

## Full of Disappointment

We began this module on frameworks with three grueling hours of videos on Semantic UI. I spent the bulk of my time trying to install Semantic UI locally on my computer. It turns out you simply need to insert references in your index.html header to link Semantic UI via the web.

Software tools in this class and I usually have quite the rocky start. It was no different in this case. However, as time progressed, I saw the benefits in how intuitive the framework was. We can look at an image tag as an example:
```
<img class="ui big image" src="./helloKitty.jpg">
```
I can easily and intuitively increase the size of my Hello Kitty image by changing the "big" in class to "massive".

## Hey Kitty, Kitty!
As one of the assignments this past week, our task was rebuild a site of our choice, using Semantic UI. My choice was to replicate <a href=">https://www.sanrio.com/">https://www.sanrio.com/</a>. I have to be "San-real" with youâ€”it turns out that the Hello Kitty website had the most "locked down" code that I have ever seen in source code for a webpage. It all began when I attempted to use image links and match colors used by the original website. The code was very compact and in a sense, obfuscated. I had issues with referencing the same links that the Sanrio website used itself. To overcome this, I had to comb through Google Images to find similar images to link into my code.

Overall, I was able to successfully replicate select sections of the webpage. Although I was not able to perfectly match everything using Semantic UI, I think that my copy looked reasonably close to the original Sanrio website.

## Friend or Foe?

Like the countless other software development tools in this class, I once again had a problematic start with the Semantic UI framework. As the week progressed and I became more familiar with the framework, I found Semantic UI to be incredibly helpful. Once you develop the correct mindset, Semantic UI helped to expedite my web development speed significantly. Just as my replicated Semantic UI website was not a perfect replicate, the two "Hello Kitties" in the adjacent picture are not perfect copies either!
