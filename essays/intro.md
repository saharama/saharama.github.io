create a technical essay (approximately 3-4 paragraphs) that discusses your interests in software engineering and what kinds of skills and experiences you hope to develop in future.

## Introduction
Aloha, my name is Matthew Sahara. This essay serves to tell a little about my professional interests and how they relate to software engineering techniques and concepts stressed in this class.

I am majoring in Electrical Engineering in the Electro-Physics track. ICS314 fulfills my Engineering Breadth and Writing Intensive academic requirements. My fields in the Computer Science department recommended this class to me because 


## Interests
Majoring in Electrical Engineering, I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant, where I analyze trends in network-based communcation between drones. We use Python scripts to analyze data and produce statistics to create profiles for specific drones.

In addition to my research work, I find Python heavily used in non-software based applications. I also am a part of the Liquid Metal Vertically Integrated project, which uses Python to collect data from a Vector Network Analyzer machine that measures transmitted and reflected power values of a device-under-test.

Over the summer, I was lucky to have the opportunity to intern with Burns & McDonnell, an engineering company that focuses on design-build construction work. I worked on the network architecture and medium-voltage switchgear for a microgrid for a community. The microgrid was designed to make the community self-sustainable, incorporating renewable energy, in the event of an emergency in which the electric utility is unable to supply power.


## Software Application
Although I am still unsure what career path and field in Electrical Engineering I want to pursue, it is apparent that software plays a big part in the simulation, automation, and efficiency in all of these fields.

As explained above, software plays a large part in the success of these labs, in both software and hardware related fields. I look forward to learning about the efficient development of software in groups. 

## Moving Forward - I See The Light!
In the future, I hope to further automate and optimize work that I see myself doing in the future.
