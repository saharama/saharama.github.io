The Covid pandemic has disrupted global human civilization. But how has it disrupted you? It can be therapeutic to spend a little bit of time reflecting on how your life has changed in the past few weeks and to think about how you might best move forward in the face of great uncertainty.

In your essay, discuss how Covid has impacted upon your life as a college student. You can discuss anything of importance to you; here are some potential topics:

## Regular Days
Hey! Your average extroverted-introvert here. In a normal day, I am usually out of the house. I love making people laugh, eating good food, and doing research in the engineering labs. Before the whole situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic happened

## Daily Routine
What has changed in your daily routine?

My 9:30am class has essentially been cancelled. Now, I get to sleep in until my 11:30am class. I feel a lot more well rested, but I do miss the morning air sometimes.

In addition, my Engineering professors have sent prewritten notes or slides to make up for the lack of a physical whiteboard. This helps because I can spend more of the time focusing on the material being taught.

## Additional Responsibilities
Thankfully, my current work obligations remain the same. I have to put a lot more time into distance learning preparation as a Teaching Assistant for my EE160 lab section. I am also able to meet virtually to discuss code and networking concepts, as a Research Assistant. I am very fortunate to retain my part-time work through this pandemic, as I know many people are facing unemployment.

For the past couple of years, I have been the primary caretaker for my grandma. With the regular school year, I am very busy, and I am only able to

I recently joined a Slack group called Helpful Engineering, which is an international effort to produce low-cost solutions to healthcare problems and resource shortages. I am hoping to join a development team and do what I can to help make a difference in the middle of all of this chaos.


## Family Time
What new things have you learned about yourself, your family, your friends, and your community?

## Moving Forward
