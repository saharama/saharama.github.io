## What in Standard Deviation?
Hey! Your average extroverted-introvert here. In a normal day, I am usually out of the house. I love making people laugh, eating good food, and doing research in the engineering labs. Before the whole situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic happened I was enjoying life. My classes were interesting, I was making good progress on my projects, and most importantly, I was eating poke at Off the Hook with my friends every week.

Just before Spring Break, it was announced that classes would be online for a while, if not for the rest of the year. Before I left school, I made sure to collect as much data as possible from the labs associated with my research projects, so I would have a sizable amount of data to analyze at home. Even if projects were sanctioned during a period of self-isolation, I was planning to stay at home, regardless, to protect my grandma from COVID-19, especially since I knew that carriers were reportedly asymptomatic.

## Learning From Home

COVID-19 has actually made it easier for me to learn. By working and learning from home, I am able to save time because I no longer have to commute to school or walk to different classes. In my opinion, the only downside to this situation is that people academic dishonesty is not controlled. I hope that by staying focused, I will still be able to earnestly get good grades that I can be proud of. In addition, my Engineering professors have sent prewritten notes or slides to make up for the lack of a physical whiteboard. This helps because I can spend more of the time focusing on the material being taught.

For the past couple of years, I have been the primary caretaker for my Popo, which means 'grandma' in Chinese. Since self-isolation measures have been enacted, I have been able to spend much more time with my Popo. Little did I know, this would be a double edged sword. My Popo does not have the best memory, and sometimes it takes all of my patience to remain calm. Every morning, she asks me if we are going out to dinner, and every morning, I have to explain to her that it is not possible to go out because of the pandemic we are facing. She also has trouble understanding how my school can be completely online. This has definitely been a bonding experience, to say the least.

## Additional Responsibilities
Thankfully, my current work obligations remain the same. I have to put a lot more time into distance learning preparation as a Teaching Assistant for my EE160 lab section. I am also able to meet virtually to discuss code and networking concepts, as a Research Assistant. I am very fortunate to retain my part-time work through this pandemic, as I know many people are facing unemployment.

I recently joined a Slack group called Helpful Engineering, which is an international effort to produce low-cost solutions to healthcare problems and resource shortages. I am hoping to join a development team and do what I can to help make a difference in the middle of all of this chaos.

## Contemplating COVID-19
In the end, I have been able to work more efficiently, and spend a lot more time with my family.
