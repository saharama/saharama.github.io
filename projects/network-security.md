I am currently analyzing wireless network traffic and adapting current software using packet analysis for UAS classification and profiling for my senior design project.

• Capturing wireless network traffic from drone using aircrack-ng suite
• Decrypting WPA2 packets using Wireshark
• Introduced to Netzob library for interpretation and reverse engineering of wireless packets
• Modifying Python scripts for statistical analysis of wireless data following the MAVLink protocol

<hr>

In previous semesters with this project, I gained familiarity with the Aircrack-ng suite and related tools using the Kali Linux operating system. (ENGR296/396 credit)
• Cracked WEP, WPA/2 encryption with aircrack-ng suite.
• Bypassed hidden SSID and MAC filtering.
• Used different flaws in wireless protocol to gain access to controlled network. Includes Cafe Latte, Man-in-the-Middle, Hirte, Mis-Association/Honeypot attacks.
