In my *EE473 Microwave Engineering* class, I did many microwave circuit simulations on an application, Microwave Office. I looked at the S-parameters of circuits, which correspond to the electromagnetic waves that enter and leave the circuit elements.

One of the highlights of this class was being able to fabricate a filter. A filter in electronics will stop all signals from being received, except those at a certain frequency. By using copper tape, we cut our filter to the specifications we designed and mounted the copper on a substrate. We then soldered on SMA connectors for analysis with the network analyzer.

The results from our fabricated filter were very close to that of our simulation. We noted the discrepancies, but it was very fun and interesting to get to do hand-ons learning in such a specialized field.
